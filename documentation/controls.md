# Controls

## Brief

These are the fundamental controls that Exponential chaos rely on. It is
strictly suggested that people should not abuse the use of certain keys, and
behave well to the game interface. The interface is not an intelligent design,
and therefore is vulnerable to hacks, lag and related events.
